## How to Use This File

1. **When news breaks:** Add to the log below with date, source, and key takeaways
2. **When writing content:** Review recent entries for awareness, not wholesale changes
3. **When positioning:** Check if our differentiators still hold against new entrants

## Current Landscape (Feb 2026)

| Category | Players | Their Focus |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| **Chat AI** | ChatGPT, Claude.ai | Consumer conversation, scale |
| **AI IDEs** | Cursor, Windsurf | Developer productivity, IDE integration |
| **Terminal Agents** | Claude Code, Codex CLI | Agentic coding in terminal |
| **Personal AI** | Moltbot | Zero-friction via existing chat apps |
| **Enterprise** | M365 Copilot, OpenAI Frontier | Compliance, integration, "AI coworkers" |

## Announcements Log

### 2026-02-05: OpenAI Frontier

**Source:** https://openai.com/index/introducing-openai-frontier/

**What it is:** Enterprise platform for "AI coworkers" with shared context, memory, identity/permissions, and Forward Deployed Engineers for implementation.

**Launch partners:** HP, Intuit, Oracle, State Farm, Thermo Fisher, Uber

**Key language they use:**
- "AI coworkers" (we don't like this jargon)
- "Opportunity gap" - what models CAN do vs what teams CAN deploy
- "Semantic layer for the enterprise"
- "Identity, permissions, and boundaries"

**What this validates for us:**
- Multi-agent orchestration matters (they're building it)
- Session continuity/memory matters (they mention it)
- Shared context matters (their "semantic layer")

**What this DOESN'T have (our differentiators still hold):**
- Full observability (they don't mention seeing inside decisions)
- Open source / portable ownership
- Provider-agnostic (it's OpenAI's platform)
- Self-serve developer experience (requires "reach out to your OpenAI team")

**Impact on our messaging:** None. Validates our direction. Strengthens "ownership" angle since Frontier is another lock-in play.

### 2026-01-XX: Moltbot Goes Viral

**Source:** TechCrunch, Twitter discourse

**What it is:** Open-source personal AI by @steipete. Runs locally, connects via WhatsApp/Telegram/Discord. Proactive, builds memory.

**Key language:**
- "Zero friction" (uses apps you already have)
- "Message it like a coworker"
- "iPhone moment" comparisons

**What this validates:**
- Proactive AI resonates
- Persistent memory matters
- Local-first has appeal

**What this doesn't have:**
- Spatial organization (everything is linear chat)
- Session continuity in our sense
- Observability
- Multi-agent coordination

## Competitive Positioning (Our Stance)

These are STABLE unless we explicitly decide to change them:

| Competitor | Our Position |
|------------|--------------|
| vs ChatGPT/Claude.ai | "Chat is for conversations. Amplifier is for getting work done—with full visibility." |
| vs Cursor/Windsurf | "IDE agents are powerful but siloed. Amplifier agents work everywhere." |
| vs Claude Code/Codex | "Great for coding. Amplifier is provider-agnostic and composable." |
| vs LangChain/CrewAI | "Frameworks demand infrastructure. Amplifier gives power with simplicity." |
| vs OpenAI Frontier | "Frontier rents you AI coworkers. Amplifier gives you AI you own." |

## Language We've Rejected

| Rejected | Why | Use Instead |
|----------|-----|-------------|
| "AI coworkers" | Dehumanizing corporate jargon | (don't name the thing, describe what you do) |
| "Agents" (alone) | Technical jargon | "AI tools", "what you build", "your setup" |
| "Switching providers" as main value | Users don't wake up wanting to switch | "Works today, works tomorrow" / durability |

---

## Language We've Embraced

- "No black boxes"
- "Observable by design"
- "See inside"
- "Composable pieces"
- "Works today. Works tomorrow."
- "Your AI, your rules"
- "The center stays still so the edges can move fast"

## Questions to Revisit

- [ ] Does "ownership" resonate more than "observability" as lead differentiator?
- [ ] How do we talk about multi-agent without using "agents"?
- [ ] Should we acknowledge competitors by name or keep it implicit?
