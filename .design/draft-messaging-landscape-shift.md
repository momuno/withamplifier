# Messaging Update: Acknowledging the Landscape Shift

## Context

Local model support is now table stakes. `ollama launch` makes it trivial to run Claude Code, OpenCode, Codex with local models. Everyone can do "use any model" now.

**The pivot:** Our differentiation isn't about WHICH models you can use. It's about WHAT you can build with them.

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Homepage Hero (Subtle Shift)

**Current:**
> "Your AI agent is a file you can read, write, and share. Not a black box you rent. A tool you own."

**Proposed:**
> "Your AI agent is a file you can read, write, and share. Not a black box you rent—no matter which model powers it."

*Why: Casually acknowledges model choice is a given, pivots to ownership.*

---

### 2. Differentiation Section — "Use any model" Card

**Current title:** "Use any model"

**Current copy:**
> "The model is a component, not a cage. Switch providers without rewriting anything. Your tools and workflows just work."

**Proposed title:** "The model is just a component"

**Proposed copy:**
> "Local or cloud, open or proprietary—the model is pluggable. But that's just the start. Your tools, workflows, and agents stay yours regardless of what powers them."

*Why: Frames model choice as solved/expected, then pivots to what's still unique (the rest of the stack is yours).*

---

### 3. Build Page — Add Portability Context

**Current intro:**
> "Install Amplifier, connect any model, and run your first command. Switch providers anytime—your agents come with you."

**Proposed:**
> "Install Amplifier, connect any model—local or cloud—and run your first command. The model is replaceable. Your agents, tools, and workflows are portable."

*Why: "Local or cloud" is now the expected baseline. The pivot is that the whole stack is portable, not just the model.*

---

### 4. Support FAQ — Update "What makes Amplifier different?"

**Current:**
> "Unlike tools that give you an AI assistant, Amplifier gives you a platform for building AI-powered tools and workflows. Three things make this real: First, the model is a component—swap providers without rewriting anything..."

**Proposed addition (insert after "swap providers"):**
> "...swap providers without rewriting anything. Everyone can run local models now—that's table stakes. What Amplifier gives you is everything else: observable execution you can debug, composable pieces you can remix, and a configuration that lives as a file you own."

*Why: Directly acknowledges the landscape shift, then pivots to durable differentiators.*

---

### 5. New Tagline Options (For Consideration)

If we want to update the overall positioning:

| Focus | Tagline |
|-------|---------|
| Platform vs Tool | "AI coding tools run models. Amplifier builds systems." |
| Ownership | "Your agents. Your models. Your stack." |
| Beyond the model | "The model is pluggable. Everything else is yours." |
| Composability | "Not just a coding tool. A platform for building them." |

## What We're NOT Doing

- ❌ Mentioning Ollama, Claude Code, OpenCode by name (not reactive)
- ❌ Claiming "local models" as a feature (now commodity)
- ❌ Chasing feature parity with coding assistants (different category)
- ❌ Downplaying model portability (still important, just not unique)

## What We ARE Doing

- ✅ Acknowledging model choice is expected ("local or cloud" as casual given)
- ✅ Pivoting to durable differentiators (observability, composability, ownership)
- ✅ Positioning Amplifier as a platform, not a tool in the same category
- ✅ Speaking to builders who want to create, not just use

---

## Tone Guidance

**Before:** "You can use any model!" (feature announcement)
**After:** "Of course you can use any model. Here's what else you get." (confident baseline)

The message is: model portability is solved. Now let's talk about what actually matters.

---

## Implementation Priority

1. **High:** FAQ update (Support page) — directly addresses the question
2. **Medium:** "Use any model" card on homepage — reframe the differentiator
3. **Low:** Hero/Build intro — subtle word changes, less urgent

---

## For Review

Does this feel right? The goal is to:
- Not ignore the landscape shift
- Not be reactive or defensive
- Confidently pivot to what's still unique
- Sound like we expected this all along (because we did)
