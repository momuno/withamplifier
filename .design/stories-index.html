Platform Feature
Shadow Environments
OS-level isolated containers for safe testing. Snapshot your local changes and test them in a fresh environment before pushing.
10 slides
Platform Feature
Session Forking
Branch your conversations at any point. Explore alternate approaches without losing your original thread. Git for conversations.
13 slides
Platform Feature
Notifications
Desktop and mobile push notifications when Amplifier needs input. Stop watching the terminal - it tells you when it's ready.
10 slides
Platform Feature
Lazy Module Activation
Just-in-time tool provisioning for spawned agents. Agents activate tools on-demand without cluttering your parent session.
11 slides
