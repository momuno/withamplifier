**Emotional Tone:** 
- Freedom
- Expansion
- Possibility
- Beauty
- Openness

**Visual Treatment:**
```
Background: Light, airy, spacious
- Base: canvas (light warm white)
- EmergenceField particle system (active, flowing)
- Gradient: subtle from-canvas/40 via-transparent to-canvas/60

Text Colors:
- Headline: text-ink (strong, clear)

```

**Feeling:** "I can see everything clearly. This is open and welcoming."

---

## Section 2: PROBLEM
**Narrative Beat:** The Constraint - "Today's AI tools are black boxes"

**Emotional Tone:**
- Constraining
- Unclear
- Opaque
- Frustrating
- Trapped

**Visual Treatment:**
```
Background: Dark, oppressive, hard to see
- Base: section-dark (deep, heavy)
- NO particle system (stillness = constraint)
- OR: Particles move slowly, trapped, constrained patterns
- Heavy gradient overlay suggesting walls

Text Colors:
- Headline: text-on-dark (muted, struggling to be seen)
- Body: text-on-dark-secondary (faded, unclear)
- Final line "Amplifier is different": text-on-dark (brighter, hint of escape)

Visual Cues:
- Compressed feeling
- Limited visual breathing room
- Dark edges closing in
- Text feels like it's fighting to be readable
```

**Feeling:** "I can't see what's happening. I'm stuck. This is frustrating."

**Transition to next section:** Should feel like emerging from darkness into light

---

## Section 3: DIFFERENTIATION - THE ANSWER
**Narrative Beat:** The Ray of Light - "Amplifier breaks you free"

**Emotional Tone:**
- Liberation
- Clarity emerging
- Relief
- Hope
- Contrast to Problem (THIS IS CRITICAL)

**Visual Treatment:**
```
Background: Transitioning from dark to light
- Start dark at top (continuity from Problem)
- Gradient toward light at bottom
- OR: section-light-gradient (light breaking through)
- Particles return, faster, more energetic
- Radial gradient from center suggesting breaking through

Text Colors:
- Headline: text-on-dark → transitioning to text-ink
- Body starts text-on-dark-secondary → becomes text-ink
- Three pillars have accent colors (signal glow)

Visual Cues:
- Space opens up
- Light literally breaks through
- Particles accelerate, become more vibrant
- Cards have subtle glow/signal accents
```

**Critical Content Addition:**
```
Headline: "Amplifier breaks you free."
OR: "Here's how Amplifier is different."
OR: "Amplifier changes all of this."

Subhead: "Open. Visible. Yours." (callback to Problem's closing line)
```

**Feeling:** "Oh! I can see now. This is the answer. I'm no longer trapped."

**Transition:** From constraint → liberation

## Chladni Resonance - The Central Storytelling Element

**Key Principle:** The Chladni particle system is THE central storytelling element. Like a real vibrating plate, each section creates a distinctive resonance pattern that reinforces the emotional and conceptual beat. The particles flow smoothly between patterns, creating a subtle visual narrative that runs throughout the entire experience.

### Pattern Meanings

| Section | Resonance Pattern | Emotional Quality | What It Communicates |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Hero** | Simple cross (n=1, m=2) | Open, welcoming, clear | "This is accessible. Come in." |
| **Problem** | Scattered chaos (n=1, m=1, high chaos) | Confusion, no structure | "This is messy. No clarity." |
| **Answer** | Three pillars (n=3, m=3) | Liberation, clarity emerging | "Here's the structure. This makes sense." |
| **Platform** | Four quadrants (n=4, m=4) | Complete, organized | "It's comprehensive. All parts work together." |
| **Demo** | Diagonal flow (n=3, m=5) | Action, motion | "This is working. Live." |
| **Bundle** | Perfect grid (n=5, m=5) | Elegant unity | "One file. Everything unified." |
| **Ecosystem** | Dense network (n=6, m=7) | Abundance, connectivity | "Whole network. You're not alone." |
| **CTA** | Central convergence (n=6, m=6) | Resolution, focus | "Here. This is the action." |

### Critical Transitions

**HERO → PROBLEM:** Structure dissolves into chaos (gradual decay)
**PROBLEM → ANSWER:** Chaos snaps into three clear pillars (dramatic, liberating - THE KEY MOMENT)
**ANSWER → PLATFORM:** Three pillars expand into four quadrants (organic growth)
**BUNDLE → ECOSYSTEM:** Simple unity becomes dense network (evolution)

### Visual Subtlety
- Opacity: Never above 0.5 - patterns support, don't dominate
- Always in motion, never static
- Transitions: 2 seconds, cubic easing (like real frequency changes)
- Particle size: 2-3px - visible but not distracting

---

## Implementation Notes

### CSS Classes Needed

```css
/* Transition sections */
.section-breakthrough {
  background: linear-gradient(
    to bottom,
    var(--canvas-dark) 0%,
    var(--canvas) 100%
  );
}

/* Particle states */
.particles-trapped { /* Slow, rigid patterns */ }
.particles-liberated { /* Fast, radiating outward */ }
.particles-networked { /* Connection patterns */ }
```

### Content Addition Required

**Section 3 (Differentiation) needs explicit callback:**

Current:
```
"One runtime. Any model. Full control."
```

Should be:
```
"Amplifier breaks you free."

Subhead: "Open. Visible. Yours."

Body: "Unlike black box tools, Amplifier shows you everything..."
```

This creates the explicit connection to the Problem section and serves as "the answer."

## User Journey Feeling

As the user scrolls, they should feel:

1. ✨ **Inspired** - "This looks interesting and open"
2. 😤 **Frustrated** - "Ugh, yes, today's tools ARE like this"
3. 💡 **Relieved** - "Oh! This IS different. I can see how."
4. 🏗️ **Confident** - "It's complete. It has everything."
5. 👀 **Convinced** - "I can see it working. This is real."
6. 🧩 **Understanding** - "I get it. It's simple but powerful."
7. 🌍 **Excited** - "There's a community. I can start now."
8. 🚀 **Ready** - "Let's do this."

Each section moves them forward emotionally AND informationally.
